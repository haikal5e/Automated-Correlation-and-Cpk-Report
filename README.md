# Automated Correlation and Cpk Report

A Python-based tool to automate pass/fail testing of semiconductor devices (voltage, current, resistance) by analyzing **mean shifts** and calculating **process capability (Cpk)**. Outputs results in CSV/Excel reports.

## Features
- ✅ **Mean Shift Analysis**: Flags units deviating from target specifications.
- ✅ **Cpk Calculation**: Evaluates process capability against engineering limits.
- ✅ **Standalone EXE**: Deployed via PyInstaller for non-technical users.
- ✅ **CSV/Excel Reports**: Automated output with pass/fail status and statistical summaries.

## Installation
